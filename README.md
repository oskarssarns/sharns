<b> Hello ! </b> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">


- ✏️ I'm a Software developer who loves to learn about new things. Currently learning <b>C#/.NET</b> @ [Codelex](https://www.codelex.io/).
I love sharing my knowledge with others


 When I'm not coding, you can find me geeking about photography and exploring different ways of documenting stories using photography.

- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm actually funny if you get to know me better.
