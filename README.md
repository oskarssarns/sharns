- ✏️ I'm a Software developer who loves to learn about new things. Currently learning <b>C#/.NET</b> @ [Codelex](https://www.codelex.io/).
I love sharing my knowledge with others


 When I'm not coding, you can find me geeking about photography and exploring different ways of documenting stories using photography.
